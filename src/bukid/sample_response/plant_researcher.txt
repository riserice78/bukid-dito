│  Tomatoes grow well in the warm temperatures of Calamba, especially during the cooler months (January-March and        │
│  November-December). The moderate humidity levels during the dry season provide ideal conditions for fruit             │
│  development and reduce fungal diseases.                                                                               │

│  **Reason for use:** Basil repels tomato hornworms, aphids, and whiteflies while improving the flavor of tomatoes.     │
│  The aromatic compounds in basil act as a natural pesticide and mask the scent that attracts harmful insects.          │
│                                                                                                                        │

│  Eggplant is heat-loving and thrives in Calamba's consistently warm temperatures throughout the year. The plant        │
│  tolerates high humidity well and produces continuously in tropical conditions, making it ideal for year-round         │
│  cultivation.                                                                                                          │

│  **Reason for use:** Hot peppers contain capsaicin, which naturally deters aphids, spider mites, and flea beetles      │
│  that commonly attack eggplants. The peppers also attract beneficial predatory insects.                                │
